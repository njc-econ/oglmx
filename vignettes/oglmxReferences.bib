abstract = {This paper describes the package maxLik for the statistical environment R. The package is essentially a uniﬁed wrapper interface to various optimization routines, offering easy access to likelihood-speciﬁc features like standard errors or information matrix equality (BHHH method). More advanced features of the optimi- zation algorithms, such as forcing the value of a particular parameter to be ﬁxed, are also supported.},

@article{Gerdtham2001,
abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between happiness (utility) and a host of socio-economic variables in a random sample of over 5,000 individuals from the Swedish adult population. The results show that happiness increases with income, health and education and decreases with unemployment, urbanisation, being single, and male gender. The relationship between age and happiness is U-shaped, with happiness being lowest in the age-group 45-64 years. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

@book{Wooldridge2002,
abstract = {This graduate text provides an intuitive but rigorous treatment of contemporary methods used in microeconometric research. The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association. The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},

@article{Hartog1998,
abstract = {We explore the effect of schooling on health, wealth and happiness for a cohort of Dutch individuals born around 1940. We also use observations on childhood IQ and family background. The most fortunate group is the group with a non-vocational intermediate level education: they score highest on health, wealth and happiness. We find that IQ affects health, but not wealth or happiness. Family background level increases wealth, but neither health nor happiness. With a father who worked independently, health, wealth and happiness are higher. Women are a miracle: compared with men, they are less wealthy, equally healthy but they are definitely happier.

@article{Carro2007a,
abstract = {This paper considers the estimation of dynamic binary choice panel data models with fixed effects. It is shown that the modified maximum likelihood estimator (MMLE) used in this paper reduces the order of the bias in the maximum likelihood estimator from O (T- 1) to O (T- 2), without increasing the asymptotic variance. No orthogonal reparametrization is needed. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate its performance in finite samples where T is not large. In probit and logit models containing lags of the endogenous variable and exogenous variables, the estimator is found to have a small bias in a panel with eight periods. A distinctive advantage of the MMLE is its general applicability. Estimation and relevance of different policy parameters of interest in this kind of models are also addressed. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.
